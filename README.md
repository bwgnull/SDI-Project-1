# SDI-Project-1
This api is a basic definition fetcher. You input the word that you'd like defined in the search bar and press search. It'll make a request to free dictionary api and return the definitions alongside synonyms, antonyms, origins, or phonetics if applicable.

I also coded an "I'm Feeling Lucky" box. This button pulls randomly from a list of about 1000 words and uses that word to make a request and pull the definition. On click it also plays the viral "jet 2 holiday" audio

A few of the shortcomings of this api is that it relies so heavily on the free dictionary api, not all of the text or information is populated for most words found. Alongside that, I did not have much passion pursuing this product and could not think of interesting new features.
